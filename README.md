# reitit-rest-api-spec-validation-dynamodb

A Clojure mini-project for a REST API for transactions.

The code for the REST API is modeled on this sample-project for `Reitit`:
[https://github.com/metosin/reitit/tree/master/examples/ring-spec-swagger](https://github.com/metosin/reitit/tree/master/examples/ring-spec-swagger)

## A note on table design

For expediency, the list of transactions is converted to a binary object (using the Faraday library). Alternatively, these transactions could be stored in a list-attribute in the same table-item, which would make them human-readable (without unpacking the binary object with Faraday).

Another approach would be to create a separate table for the transaction-lists; and then store a key (or keys) to this table in the item in the current table. While this would necessitate a separate request to DynamoDB, it would make the transactions themselves more query-able.

The precise design chosen would depend on the queries expected on the data. (In DynamoDB, above all, it's important to avoid any "table-scans" for querying.)


## Prerequisites (esp. a local DynamoDB)

Aside from Java SDK & Leiningen, this mini-project depends on a local DynamoDB.

Instructions from Amazon on installing DynamoDB locally...

[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html)

An alternative way to install a local DynamoDB, if you're on a Mac:

`brew install dynamdb-local`


## Running the server

Run DynamoDB Local:

```
dynamodb-local -sharedDb -dbPath ~/Downloads
```

Create a DynamoDB table for the transactions:
```
create-dynamo-table.sh
```

Run the server to expose the local REST API:
```
lein run
```

## Command-line HTTP requests

The command-line tool, [https://httpie.io/](Httpie), can be used to send HTTP requests to the REST API.

A sample POST request, to create an item in the DynamoDB table.

```
echo '{ "customerid": "98765", "date": "Tue, 04 May 2021 21:24:23 GMT", "currency": "USD", "txns": [ { "desc": "apparel Xyz", "qty": 1, "amount": 5000 } ] }' | http POST :3000/transactions
```

In the following command, substitute the `timestamp` returned from the previous one above; this is a sample GET request, to retrieve an item from the DynamoDB table.

```
http GET :3000/transactions customerid=="98765" timestamp==1620203315904
```

Again, update the timestamp below, then run a PUT request, to update an item in the DynamoDB table:

```
echo '{ "customerid": "98765", "timestamp": 1620203535459, "date": "Tue, 05 May 2021 12:25:34 GMT", "currency": "USD", "txns": [ { "desc": "makeup X", "qty": 1, "amount": 9000 } ] }' | http PUT :3000/transactions
```

(This is a straightforward overwrite of the entire table-item; various more subtle partial-updates could be implemented instead.)


## Run tests

```
lein test
```

## Swagger API documentation

Run the server (see above) & open this page in the browser:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
